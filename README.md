# [This is Jeoparody!](https://clairemuller.github.io/jeoparody/)

This project was built as part of Flatiron School's Web Development Immersive curriculum.

After learning Ruby on Rails, we were tasked with creating a SPA (Single Page Application) using vanilla JavaScript with a Rails backend. I found an awesome API, [JService](http://jservice.io/), with over 150,000 clues spanning ~30 seasons of Jeopardy.

This was my very first solo project, and I wrote a [blog post](https://dev.to/clairemuller/4-things-i-learned-from-building-my-first-site-solo-1e26) discussing some important things I learned. Check it out!
